## Installation

just put the complete project on a usb and add your model in the models folder

preferrably with the name 'your-model'.gguf

```bash
from there on out, it's just a matter of runnning the .sh script if you're on linux and running the batch file if you're on windows
```
    
## Lessons Learned

well, mostly just how cool ai is without a rate limiter and active censoring.

also this allowed me to have an assistant in my college systems where the network sucks.
